    "# Automating Trades with IBridgePy & IBKR: Breakdown of Code for understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithmic trading is changing the way markets work. Instead of manually placing trades, we can use **Python** and **IBridgePy** to automate the process, making trading more efficient and strategic. I’ve been exploring IBridgePy, a powerful tool that connects Python with several brokerage, Here in my example I used **Interactive Brokers (IBKR)** for automated trading. Let me break it down in a simple way.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Connecting IBridgePy to IBKR\n",
    "\n",
    "To start using IBridgePy, you need to connect it to your **Interactive Brokers (IBKR) account**. You only need **one** of the following software:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IB Trader Workstation (TWS)** – If you want a graphical interface while trading.\n",
    "- **IB Gateway** – If you just want a lightweight connection without a GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠ **You don’t need both — just pick one that suits your needs, I used the TWS in my case for testing this out.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This connection gives the package access to your trading account and allows it to pull real time market data and place trades.\n"

    "## For the first part:  Handling Market Data in Real Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Market data is the core of any trading strategy. With IBridgePy, we use the `handle_data()` function to process it automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a **real time assistant** that checks stock prices for us every minute and lets us react instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  `handle_data()` function\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def handle_data(context, data):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    pass\n",
    "    # This stores variables like account balance, positions, etc\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Real time Market Price\n",
    "\n",
    "To fetch the **latest market price** of an asset in real-time, we use:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "show_real_time_price(security, field=\"price\")\n",

    "One of the coolest features of IBridgePy is that you can **automate when your trading functions run**—like telling your bot, “Check the market 5 minutes after opening every day.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This is super useful for traders who don’t want to sit and monitor the screen all day. You just schedule a function and let it do the work for you.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "schedule_function(my_func, date_rules.every_day(), time_rules.market_open(minutes=5))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells IBridgePy: “Run the function `my_func` every single trading day, but wait for 5 minutes after the market opens.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Run a function every Tuesday, 5 minutes after the market opens\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we’re telling it: “Run `my_func` every **Tuesday** (since offset=1 makes Monday + 1 = Tuesday), and again, wait 5 minutes after the bell.”\n",
